In Python, a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. It is used to provide documentation or a brief description of the purpose and usage of the code that follows it. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (either single or double), and they are used to help developers understand the functionality of the code without having to examine the source code itself.


Key Points


* Docstrings are accessible using the __doc__ attribute of the object.

* They can be displayed using the help() function in interactive Python sessions.

* Popular tools like Sphinx and PyCharm utilize Docstrings to generate comprehensive documentation.
